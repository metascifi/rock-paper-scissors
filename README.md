# rock-paper-scissors

Rock-paper-scissors is a game where you and your opponent have three option to pick: 
- Rock 
- Paper 
- Scissors

Your picked option should be "thrown" with your opponent at the same time and there could be different results: 
1. Rock beats paper.
2. Paper beats rock.
3. Scissors beat paper.

You play 5 round with a bot. The higher win number the bigger score you have so it means you win (or lose if the enemies score bigger).
